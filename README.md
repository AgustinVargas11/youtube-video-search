# Youtube video search

This is a very basic web application that allows you to search for Youtube videos.

I removed my Youtube API key, in order for the application to work you must obtain your own.
Follow the guide below to do so.

###Getting Started###

After obtaining your API KEY, paste it in index.js

```

    const API_KEY = YOUR API KEY HERE;

```

Run the project using the command **npm start**, then visit **http://localhost:8080** in your browser.
